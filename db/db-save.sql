INSERT INTO `TECHNOLOGY` VALUES (1,'DNA probes: Detecting pathogens on the dot','DNA Probe Kits contain highly specific probes for the detection of bacterial pathogens in milkfish such as Vibrio anguillarum, Photobacterium damselae, Nocardia seriolae, Vibrio parahaemolyticus, and other pathogenic bacteria such as Klebsiella pneumonia and Staphylococcus saprophyticus. Highly specific probes are essential components for pathogen detection using quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) technology. 52The qPCR technology offers greater sensitivity, rapidity, specificity, and ability for quantitative detection of pathogens. Using the DNA probe kits, the amplification of gene and detection of pathogen are seen in real-time. It does not require post-PCR steps such as gel-based analysis as in conventional end-point PCR, which is time-consuming, laborious, and unsafe. DNA probe kits are used in qPCR assays to detect the presence of pathogens in diseased fish or in water samples. The rapid detection of pathogenic bacteria from samples obtained in hatcheries and fish farms allows implementation of immediate remedial or preventive measures of the disease and formulation of better strategies for disease management in fish farming. ',NULL,1),(2,'Automatic fry counter: Accurate laser fry counting for milkfish','Milkfish is an important food fish comprising 8% of the total animal protein intake of Filipinos. Traditionally cultured in brackish water ponds, rearing of milkfish has expanded in lakes and more recently, in the marine environment. Aside from grow-out culture, selling of milkfish fry has also been a profitable aspect of the overall milkfish production. Counting using scoop net or small cup, however, is laborious and inaccurate. Faced with this problem, researchers from University of the Philippines Visayas (UPV) have developed a prototype “automatic fry counter” as a solution. Designs for the automated fry counter have been based on initial observations of fry swimming behavior through video documentation. Components of the fry counter, such as the holding chamber and counting channel, have been designed to minimize stress during the counting process and reduce the time it takes to count the fry. The counting mechanism utilizes a simple set-up composed of a light source (laser), receptor (phototransistor), and a small processor (Arduino-UNO chipset) to carry out the actual counting process. The simple design has kept estimated costs for the fry counter under PhP 5,000. Latest trials of the counting mechanism have shown 95% accuracy with six pieces fry per second counting rate.',NULL,1),(3,'Genome-based lateral flow strip biosensor kit: Quick detection, quick response against shrimp diseases','One of the keys to reducing the risk of diseases in shrimp is prevention and early detection. A rapid method that involves the use of genome-based lateral flow strip biosensor has been developed as a diagnostic platform for white spot syndrome virus and other shrimp pathogens. The test strips are field-ready, with an extraction and mobile device kit for first level screening of pathogens on site. Test strips may also be coupled with PCR amplification of DNA extracts for faster and low level detection. The test strips may be multiplexed for simultaneous detection of more than one pathogen. The use of mobile strip reader and an accompanying application (app) instantaneously allows the test results of the diagnostic strips to be fed into an on-line pathogen information resource and biosurveillance system. The mobile strip reader will link the data captured by the app to a cloud server, which in turn is linked to a biosurveillance data center at the Southeast Asian Fisheries Development Center (SEAFDEC). The lateral flow strip biosensor has four major parts. The first is a sample pad where liquid shrimp samples will be dropped. A conjugated pad contains gold nanoparticles conjugated with DNA sequences specific to the target pathogen. A nitrocellulose membrane contains the test line and control line. The absorption pad wicks the liquid sample to the end of the strip through capillary action.  This screening test is cost-competitive and when used in the field will allow for more regular and wider sampling for early detection of shrimp diseases.',NULL,2),(4,'LAMP: New simple tool for detecting virus in shrimps','Loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) is a new molecular technique available, which can equal the PCR in specificity and\n        offers higher sensitivity and rapid detection under isothermal conditions. Sensitivity of the reaction is enhanced by the use of four to six specially designed primers to detect white spot syndrome virus (WSSV). LAMP is ten times more sensitive for the detection of WSSV than conventional PCR. The use of four to six primers, instead of the usual two primers in PCR, also speeds up the reaction thereby reducing detection time. Results can therefore be obtained within one hour.  It does not require complicated and expensive equipment like a thermocycler. Reaction can be performed within one hour at a constant temperature (isothermal condition) ranging from 600 to 650 o C using a laboratory heatblock or waterbath. Because of its convenience, simplicity, and speed of detection, LAMP can therefore be used for on-site detection of WSSV in shrimp. Moreover, the practicality of LAMP assay makes it an effective tool for routine diagnosis for early detection of WSSV or any pathogen so proper health management procedures can be implemented to prevent mortality and avert economic losses.',NULL,2),(5,'Pinoy longline: An innovative and sustainable way of growing mussels','The Pinoy longline is a modified and cheaper version of the longline culture system used by New Zealand for producing high-quality mussel. The method is suitable for deeper waters and may be used to replace the stake method which causes sedimentation in coastal areas. The Pinoy longline culture system is composed of a 50-m main line made of 20-mm polypropylene rope. Attached in the main line are black plastic containers (40 cm x 35 cm x 19 cm) used as floaters which are discarded materials used for transporting oil and soy sauce. On both ends of the line, two plastic containers (91 cm x 37 cm) covered with polyethylene rope are used. To maintain the longline, anchors (approximately 152 cm x 127 cm x 102 cm) are placed on both sides. For stocking, mussel socks made of 2-m long and 10-mm thick polyethylene rope with cylindrical cement weighing 1 kg at the bottom are used. Mussel spats (2–3 cm) are placed inside the mussel sock at 200 pieces/m of sock. Mussel socks are tied to the longline at 50 cm interval.',NULL,3),(6,'Soft opportunities for mud crab exports','Soft-shell crabs are not distinct or special crab species, but are mud crabs or \'alimango\' (Scylla spp.) that have molted or shed their hard outer shells in preparation for growth. The hard shell must be shed in order for the crabs to grow. A soft, pliable crab emerges and expands its new shell. The shell of the crab starts to harden within hours. Scylla spp. juveniles (crablets) are obtained from hatcheries and reared in net cages until 3–4 cm size and grown further in ponds for 1.5–2.0 months until they attain 60–100 g body weight. At this size, crabs are placed individually in perforated plastic boxes on polyvinyl chloride (PVC) floating platforms set in brackish water ponds. The crabs are fed with mollusks or low value fish every 2 days. Molting is monitored every 4 hours. Newly molted crabs are kept in aerated freshwater to prevent hardening of shell. After one hour, the soft-shelled crabs are sorted and packed in plastic food containers for freezing.',NULL,4),(7,'Marine annelid as broodstock diet improves larval performance of mangrove crabs','Breeding and culture techniques were developed for the culture of marine annelid (Marphysa mossambica) (63.2% crude protein and 0.8% crude fat) to supply the nutritional requirements of mud crab broodstock. Zoeae from broodstock fed with 20% pathogen-free annelid in formulated diet contained higher levels of total lipids and highly unsaturated fatty acid (HUFA), which can improve the larval performance. Feeding the zoeae with formulated diets reduced the use of natural food in the hatchery. In the nursery phase, improved survival of 70% in Phase 1 and 70–90% in Phase 2 were achieved. Bait-size polychaetes were used as feed (live or dry meal added in formulation) for crab broodstock. Natural food live Marphysa produced higher number (p<0.05) of zoea than the natural food without live Marphysa. Formulated diet containing 20% Marphysa produced higher number (p<0.05) of zoea than 10% Marphysa. Natural food live Marphysa + formulated diet 20% M produced higher number (p<0.05) of zoea than those without live Marphysa.',NULL,4),(8,'GIS application for risk assessment in aquaculture','Geographic information system (GIS) is a spatial decision support system or a system for input, storage, analysis, output, and display of geographic data or geographically-referenced information. GIS technology integrates spatial and other related information within a single computer system and allows access to attribute information by geographic location. A comprehensive geo-referenced database of tilapia ponds in Pampanga was developed. Data were used to determine the  suitability of fishponds in 21 municipalities for aquaculture based on: a) selected farm practices; b) fish kill and disease occurrences; c) results on soil quality; and d) results on water quality. Digital mapping and modelling was performed using the ArcGIS software with Environmental Systems Research Institute (ESRI) base maps and downloaded satellite images as references. The Analytic Hierarchy Process, a decision support tool was used to determine the overall suitability of aquaculture in Pampanga.',NULL,5),(9,'Microalgae: Potential feed for aquaculture species','Microalgae are microscopic floating aquatic organisms that contain one cell and no roots, stems, or leaves. These algae have\n      different shapes and colors and are very small, usually one quarter of a millimeter. The color of the microalgae cell depends on their pigments, which can either appear in blue-green, yellow, brown, or orange. These small aquatic plants are usually found in marine and freshwater environments, which are considered as one of the most important water organisms due to its utilization in various fields. The species serve as natural food for milkfish, shrimp, tilapia, and other finfishes and crustaceans at different stages. It is also a potential feed ingredient for culture of different aquaculture species. Microalgae production plays a very important role in the field of aquaculture. The four commonly used microalgae species in aquaculture include Tetraselmis sp., Nannochloropsis sp., Chaetoceros calcitrans, and Chlorella vulgaris. These species are currently utilized for mass production of algal pastes, the concentrated liquid microalgae cells used as feed for larval fish, shrimp, and other aquaculture species. The commercial algal paste costs about US $150/L.',NULL,6),(10,'Harnessing S&T for a sustainable and competitive sea cucumber industry','Sea cucumbers are high value marine invertebrates that used to abound in the country’s coastal waters. There are about 200 sea cucumber species in the country, which include 40 species that are of high value. The Philippines was a top producer of dried sea cucumbers (also known as beche-de-mer or trepang) in the 1980s. Due to unregulated harvesting and trade, total annual production is now less than 900 t. This pulled down the country to being the third sea cucumber producer.

Seaweeds ranked as the country’s 2 nd major fishery export in 2013 contributing 18% share to the total export earnings. USA, China, and Belgium are among the major markets for Philippine seaweed products. Seaweed production comprised 65.66% of the total aquaculture production in 2013. Until 2008 when it was overtaken by Indonesia, the Philippines was the world’s No. 1 producer of raw materials for carrageenan. The decline in farm production is due to decreasing quality of seedstocks; unavailability of seedstocks for farming due to outbreak of diseases such as ‘ice-ice’ and presence of epiphytes; and decreasing carrying capacity of farms.','The Seaweed R&D program aims to:',10),(14,'Benham Rise: The Philippines’ new territory off Aurora','Benham Rise, a 13-million hectare undersea region east of Luzon, is the Philippines’ new territory. Most of the Rise is about 2,000– 5,000 m deep but a seamount on the southern part rises to 50 m below the surface and is called the Benham Bank. The Benham Rise region is an extension of the Philippines’ continental shelf and is believed to be rich in living and non-living resources such as minerals and gas. An all-Filipino marine scientific research cruise was conducted to assess the benthic habitats and water column biological productivity in the vicinity of the Benham Bank and investigate the interaction between the ocean currents and topography. The cruise provided the first research effort of documenting deep-water biodiversity in the Philippines.',NULL,11),(15,'Diagnostic kit for abaca virus','The diagnostic kit developed for the detection of abaca bunchy top virus (ABTV) is based on the principle of dot-ELISA (Enzyme Link Immunosorbent Assay). The primary component of the diagnostic kit is the antiserum generated to specifically detect the presence of the virus. The generated antibody can detect infection in the lowest concentration. The activity and sensitivity of the generated antisera are comparable to that of the commercial kit and its effectivity in identifying ABTV-free and ABTV-positive plants has been confirmed.',NULL,12),(16,'Adding higher value to abaca','Abaca (Musa textilis Nee) is a plant indigenous to the Philippines. Its fiber is the strongest among natural fibers. The country supplies about 85% of the world’s demand, mainly as pulp, raw fibers, ropes, yarns, and fibercrafts. Ironically, the Philippines imports back abaca in the form of specialty paper products (security/ currency base papers, tea bags, filters).\n The research and development program on abaca for specialty papers, textile and other high value products will help push for the optimum use of our abaca resources to benefit the local pulp and paper industry, and the abaca sector in general. The program has components on characterizing abaca fiber (both commercial and new varieties) and processing/value adding with the ultimate goal of encouraging local production of high-value abaca-based products, such as textile, security/currency base paper, tea bags, packaging and printing/writing papers, and nanocrystalline cellulose (NCC), and abaca-based toxic metal ion adsorbent.',NULL,12),(17,'High-yielding and virus-resistant abaca hybrid','Abaca (Musa textilis Nee.) or Manila hemp is indigenous to the Philippines and considered as one of the country’s most important crops.

The incidence of Fusarium wilt caused by Fusarium oxysporum f. sp. cubense (Foc) Tropical Race 4 (TR4) in 2012 threatened the million-dollar export industry of the Philippines. \n Introduced Cavendish somaclones from Taiwan were tested on Philippine soil and two showed promising performance in terms of productivity and market acceptability– the giant Cavendish tissue culture variant (GCTCV) 218 and 219. GCTCV 218 produces fingers and yield that are almost similar to Grand Nain (GN) at an average of 25 kilograms (kg)/bunch (note: GN averages 30 kg/bunch). GCTCV 219, on the other hand has relatively lower yield at an average of 18 kg/bunch but is sweeter and can be marketed as highland banana.\n Application of commercially-available microbial agents such as Trichoderma harzianum enhances action against Foc TR4 in GCTCV 218, a moderately resistant somaclone while GCTCV 219, which is very resistant to Fusarium wilt no longer requires microbial agents even in infested soil.',NULL,13),(19,'Use of developed lakatan to address banana bunchy top','Banana bunchy top virus (BBTV) is the most destructive virus disease of banana in the country as its severe incidence could wipe out a plantation singlehandedly.

Somatic embryos that will develop into mature plants are produced from tissues of the leaves and stems of coffee varieties with superior characteristics without seed formation/fertilization. This results in mass production of true-to-type plants (plants that are genetically similar with each other). \nMaintenance of genetic integrity leads to the preservation of the favored characteristics of a coffee variety even after many generations of reproduction.

It is reported to infect over 200 insect pest species and is currently being used as a biological insecticide to control a number of pests. The sweet potato weevil isolate of Metarhizium was found effective in controlling jackfruit fruit borer, with an infection rate of 84.75. Immature stages of jackfruit fruit borer are most vulnerable because they are still on the surface of the fruit which are directly hit by the Metarhizium suspension during application. Jackfruit fruit borer could infest in all fruit stages except the ripe stage, thereby causing considerable loss in jackfruit production.',NULL,16),(25,'Optimized vacuum-fried and dehydrated jackfruit products','Vacuum-fried jackfruit is a nutritious product from jackfruit pulp processed at low temperature (below 1000C) thereby maintaining the fruit’s color, flavor, sweetness and nutritional qualities.

The Asha (NSIC Pn 15) and Namnama 2 (NSIC Pn 14) varieties developed in 2002–2010 yield 2.2–3.5 t/ha as compared with the 0.60 t/ha produced by the native variety. These are big-seeded and are suitable for confectionery, often called 3-in-1 because they produce three seed classes. Continuous varietal improvement and trials are being done in various peanut-growing regions to evaluate the seeds’ performance and location specificity. The results serve as bases in selecting varieties for seed multiplication to enhance the peanut value chain.\n Through the PCAARRD Peanut R&D program, and in partnership with the DA, two new peanut varieties were approved by the National Seed Industry Council from 2013 to 2015—the NSIC Pn 2013 17 (ICGV 95390) also known as \"G.D. Lasam-Pride\" and NSIC 2013 Pn 18 (ICGV 01273) or Namnama 3. The NSIC Pn 19 (ICGV 96176) or Namnama 4 was recently nominated for NSIC registration and approval. These improved confectionery varieties are ideal for processing and were born from International Crops Research Institute for the Semi-Arid Tropics (ICRISAT)-bred varieties adapted to semi-arid conditions and localized to Cagayan Valley conditions, and eventually in major peanut growing areas of the country. \nThe development of improved varieties coupled with improved storage technologies and practices is a helpful input for the improvement of peanut seed production management to be adopted under the formal and informal seed system for the attainment of sustainable supply of quality seeds.',NULL,18),(28,'Improving productivity through improved soil nutrient and pest management practices','The package of technology (POT) on peanut includes the adoption of recommended soil nutrient and pest management practices such as seed inoculation using Rhizobium, gypsum fertilization and the use of biological control agents (BCAs). \nPeanut can fix 45 kg of nitrogen (N)/ha through the root nodule bacteria using Rhizobium (Bradyrhizobium spp.). It is responsible in converting atmospheric N in a form available to plants. Inoculating the seeds prior to planting will boost root development and growth and this practice cuts down on production cost by reducing the use of inorganic fertilizers. \nApplication of gypsum or calcium sulfate, on the other hand, provides calcium for direct absorption by the plant. Calcium helps develop pods and reduces \"pops\" or unfilled pods, as well as seed rot caused by fungi. \nOn pest management, recent studies showed that Metarhizium anisopliae, a microbial control agent, can control leaf hopper and leaf folder in peanut. Metarhizium is a green muscardine fungus, which is safe to humans and animals and easy to mass produce. It is easy to apply and is compatible with other pest management options. Trichogramma spp., also a BCA, is efficient against cutworm, leaf folder, and leaf hopper. Trichogramma are dark-colored tiny wasps and the most widely used BCA in the world. A single Trichogramma, while multiplying itself, can destroy over 100 eggs of the pest. It offers a lower and more effective plant protection option than insecticides.',NULL,18),(29,'Improvement of peanut seed storage system through super grain bag','Large -seeded confectionery peanut varieties like Namnama 1 and 2 and Asha were found to have quick seed deterioration and poor storability due to high oil content, hence, there is a need to improve the post-harvest handling specifically on drying and seed storage practices. The super grain bag (SGB) makes the principle of hermetic storage available to farmers and processors at low cost. Super grain bags reduce the flow of both oxygen and water between the stored seed and the outside atmosphere. The stability of seed moisture inside the bag prevents wetting and drying, and this stability reduces kernel breakage in peanut thus recovery is high during shelling. \nBased on recent studies on peanut seed packaging and storage, the use of SGB and jute sacks with transparent lining are the most appropriate and cost effective for seed storage. The packaging materials can maintain good seed germination of 80-83% until the 12th month of storage under cold and ambient condition. \n The development of SGB is helpful in the improvement of peanut seed production management. It can be adopted under the formal and informal seed system leading to the attainment of sustainable supply of quality seeds for enhanced peanut productivity.',NULL,18),(30,'Enhancing peanut productivity through boron fertilization','Boron is one of the seven micronutrients required for normal growth and development of plants.

As of 2014, growth of the sector was reported to be 2.84%. In terms of milk production, the sector contributed 33.6% of domestic production in 2013. The bulk of the production came from cows from smallholder farms of various dairy cooperatives. Currently, there are 2,688 families engaged in dairy buffalo production. Increasing the productivity of the buffaloes would improve the economic well-being of the dairy buffalo farmers nationwide. Hence, PCC initiated a genetic improvement program for the Philippine dairy buffaloes to increase its milk production potential and productivity. The cows at the various dairy cooperatives are the direct beneficiaries of the improved genetics. However, due to the absence of a substantial “herd” size, the conventional genetic evaluation system is apparently not applicable to smallholder farms. Thus, recording and performance evaluation as well as identification of AI sires and replacement bulls and heifers are done at the institutional herds. While genetic progress is being achieved and is increasing on a yearly basis, based on conventional quantitative genetics (BLUP breeding value estimation), the rate of genetic gain still needs to improve. To address the very slow rate of milk production improvement, a research project on Genotyping the Philippine water buffaloes, is being implemented by PCC. Field verification of the phenotypic expression of genetic characteristics related to milk production and application of gene marker technology in breeding and selection are being employed for improved milk production. This will eventually increase milk production by 40%.

Cut the top part of the rootstock leaving one leaf storey.\n3.   Make an incision at the center of the stem.\n4.   Insert the scion.\n5.   Wrap and seal the union site with plastic wrap.\n6.   Allow the grafted seedling to grow under 75% shade. Water as needed. \n7.   After 21 days, inspect for the growth of leaf buds. \n8.   Open and remove half of the wrap to allow new leaves to grow.\n 9.   When the leaves mature (approximately 1 month), remove the remaining wrap. \n10. Remove the plastic seal and the leaves of the rootstock after 2 months.\n11. The grafted seedling is ready for field planting.',NULL,34),(57,'Emeralds from the forests','The use of quality planting materials can increase the survival rate of tree seedlings in the nursery by 40%. Seedlings from quality seeds are healthy, vigorously growing, disease-free, and have a robust and woody (lignified) single stem that are free of deformities. They have a large root collar diameter, dense, healthy root system with many fine, fibrous hairs at the root tips. The seedlings also have a balance shoot and root mass and are accustomed to short periods without water and full sunlight.',NULL,35),(58,'Green gold from the forests','For giant bamboo propagation (Dendrocalamus asper Schultes f.), branch cuttings from 3 to 4 year-old culms are the best planting materials. At least 10 branches can be collected from one culm. Each branch should have 2–3 nodes and live buds. The branch cuttings sprout 7–10 days after potting. Proper care and maintenance are necessary for potted branch cuttings. Usually, potted propagules are ready for outplanting in 3–4 months or longer.\n Meanwhile, ‘kawayan tinik’ (Bambusa blumeana J. A. & A.H. Schultes f.) is propagated through one–node culm cuttings. One-node cuttings should have an equal portion of the lower (below the node) and upper (above the node) internodes of about 4–6 cm. These cuttings are obtained from the mother culms. Rooted cuttings with sprouts are exposed to full sunlight for better growth. Potted cuttings are ready for outplanting in 6–12 months.\n For ornamental bamboo, the propagation techniques are culm cutting, branch cutting, marcotting, and division or offset. The commonly used method is division or offset. Newly-developed bamboo shoot from a clump is allowed to grow to its height with fully developed leaves and branches before it is separated from the clump.\n Clump management is necessary to improve bamboo clump productivity in general. This is done through regular tending operations, which includes cleaning, thinning, mounding, mulching, and fertilization. Old bamboo clumps can also be rehabilitated/ rejuvenated through the application of suitable cultural treatments such as sanitation cutting, cleaning, or fertilizer application. This offers a quick and cheap means of increasing the supply of bamboo.',NULL,36),(59,'Smarter moves for a competitive agriculture','One of the most affected sectors by climate change in the Philippines is agriculture. Harnessing the present advances in science and technology, the Smarter Approaches to Reinvigorate Agriculture as an Industry in the Philippines (SARAI) aims to provide agriculture stakeholders access to near real-time scientific information on pressing questions in the context of agricultural uncertainties caused by climate variabilities and extremes. It is anchored on precision agriculture by optimizing the use of crop simulation modelling (CSM), remote sensing and geographic information systems (RS/GIS), and field sensors to develop decision support models for crop forecasting, crop advisories, and early warning systems. Initially, it focuses on six priority crops: rice, corn, banana, coconut, coffee, and cacao. \n As of 2015, the program has already produced outputs that can be grouped into four categories: \n •  technologies (Smarter Pest Identification Technology [SPId Tech], and cost-efficient soil moisture monitoring system for soil water deficit); \n •  systems (Water Management Decision Support System (WAISS), SARAI Enhanced Agricultural Monitoring System (SEAMS), and Maize Nutrient Expert); \n •  data products (crop suitability maps for the six crops); and •  networks/connections/linkages established.','To aid in the statistical modelling for the crop forecasts and advisories, SARAI has also been using automatic weather stations (AWS) and unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) to provide real-time weather data.',37);
